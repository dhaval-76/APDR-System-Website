# **`APDR System`**

> - A Simple cost efficient project used for Accident Detection, Prevention and Reporting and Vehicle to Vehicle communication using Li-Fi technology
> - A Web Application is created using React in order to display all the necessary data from the firebase which is obtained from the sensors using ESP8266 WiFi module

<h3>Abstract</h3>

><p style='text-align: justify;'>In present era, one of the main >cause of road mishap/accidents is that after driving hundreds of 
>kilometers at a time, the driver becomes fatigued and 
>eventually falls asleep while driving. The motorist may 
>potentially be completely oblivious of any vehicle flaws. 
>The number of hit-and-run accidents caused by drivers
>mostly due to intoxication is on the increasing on daily 
>basis. As a result, there is an urgent need for a device that 
>stops this from happening, so that many lives can be 
>spared every day. Humans' greatest concern is their 
>safety. We need to be especially cautious when it comes to 
>driving As a result, the main objective of this project is to 
>create a feasible solution to these safety concerns. A 
>automobile will be used to house the proposed system. 
>The driver will be given goggles that have infrared 
>sensors built into them. If the motorist is discovered to be 
>drowsy or under the influence of alcohol, the driver will 
>be charged. If the driver does not stop the automobile 
>after many buzzers, the car will begin to slow down and 
>eventually stop. The device also has a feature that allows 
>you to follow your automobile by sending GPS 
>coordinates to the local emergency services whenever it is 
>involved in an accident. The system will use Li-fi 
>technology to provide vehicle-to-vehicle communication 
>(using light signals). By reporting any type of 
>irresponsible driving to the nearest control room, this will 
>help improve general road safety. In the future, every car 
>may be required by law to have such a safety system 
>installed for the protection of the driver and passengers. 
>As a result, the system provides a full solution for 
>preventing accidents, resulting in the daily saving of a 
>large number of lives.
